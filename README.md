# Finances_Project

## Motivation: 
In recent years I’ve accumulated over $1.5K worth of credit card debt that I would like to pay off before I buy a house in 2024. I need to analyze how I’ve been spending my money and create budget categories. With my expenses aggregated I would like to plan a way to pay off debts faster (within the next year and a half).

## Objective: 
This project will find at least one area of my budget where I can decrease spending and funnel that money towards paying off debts.

## Scope: 
The budget plan must create at minimum $6,000 to put towards debts between August 2022 and July 2023.

### Success factors:
If my increase in debt payments is 10 percent more than during the first half of 2022;
If one or more of my (credit card) debts are paid off in less than a year;
And if my spending habits stay within the constraints outlined below

### Assumptions and Constraints: (Limiting Factors)
  - Assumption: There is money spent in my monthly budget on items that are not a necessity to my daily life. I can adjust how I spend to increase debt payments.

  - Constraints: I can adjust my flexible spending each month; however, I can not decrease the amounts I spend on rent or my car payment. My spending must allow me to maintain my current apartment to avoid incurring other additional expenses like higher gas prices due to longer commutes to work. 

## Requirements:
```
- Identify which spending categories I pay the most money to each month
- Provide a budget adjustment capable of being implemented within the next 6 to 12 months
- Create a way to monitor the progress of my increased debt payments
```

## Clarifying Questions:
```
- Why have I not paid off my credit card balances in full?
- When do I spend the most money each month?
- How much money do I have to spend towards my debt?
- Which debt source should I plan to pay off first?
- Which pay off strategy should I take? (avalance, snowball, or other)
```
